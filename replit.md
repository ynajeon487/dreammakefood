# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool

**Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing with the following pages:
- Home page with hero section and featured recipes
- Recipes listing and detail pages
- Menu planning (three modes: by-day, by-meal, and by-ingredients with servings support)
  - `/menu` - Main selection page with 3 aligned option cards
  - `/menu/by-day` - Daily menu generator (budget, servings, meals/day, diet, skill level)
  - `/menu/by-meal` - Single meal recipe generator (budget, servings, diet, optional dish name)
  - `/menu/by-ingredients` - Multiple recipe suggestions from available ingredients (ingredients, servings, optional budget, diet, skill level)
- Shopping list management
- Knowledge base with cooking tips

**UI Component Library**: Shadcn/ui (New York style variant) built on top of Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS for styling

**State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query v5) for server state management with custom query client configuration

**Design System**:
- Color palette based on olive green tones (#556B2F primary, #8FA31E secondary, #C6D870 tertiary, #EFF5D2 background)
- Typography using Inter for UI elements and Lexend for headings/Vietnamese text
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- Custom CSS variables for light/dark mode support with elevation states (hover-elevate, active-elevate)

**Key Features**:
- AI chatbot component with markdown parsing for formatted responses
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Recipe filtering and search functionality
- Interactive menu generation forms with validation
- Ingredient-based recipe suggestions with searchable ingredient library (60+ common Vietnamese ingredients)
- **Warning Banners**: Testing phase notifications across pages
  - **AutoDismissBanner Component** (Reusable): Yellow warning banner with "Trang web đang trong quá trình thử nghiệm." message, AlertCircle icon, auto-dismisses after 5 seconds (toast-like behavior), framer-motion animation with AnimatePresence for smooth entry/exit, appears on every page load (no localStorage persistence), centered layout
    - Applied to 9 pages: Home, Menu, Recipes, Shopping, MenuByDay, MenuByIngredients, MenuByMeal, RecipeDetail, NotFound (404)
    - ARIA accessibility support: role="status" and aria-live="polite" for screen readers
    - data-testid: `banner-testing-warning`
  - **Knowledge Page Banner** (Permanent): Same yellow warning banner but always visible at top of page without auto-dismiss or exit animation, data-testid: `banner-knowledge-warning`

**Animation System**: Framer Motion integration with comprehensive accessibility support
- **Implementation Approach**: Two-layer animation system ensuring accessibility compliance
  - **Layer 1 (JavaScript)**: `useReducedMotion` hook from framer-motion conditionally disables all animations
  - **Layer 2 (CSS)**: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` globally disables CSS-based motion effects
- **Animated Components**:
  - RecipeCard: Fade-in slide-up with stagger (delay: index * 0.1s), hover scale (1.02), tap scale (0.98), image zoom on hover (scale 1.1)
  - Hero: Background zoom-in (scale 1.1 → 1), sequential text fade-ins (delays: 0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s)
  - FeatureCards: Stagger fade-in from bottom (delay: index * 0.15s), hover lift (y: -8px), icon rotation on hover (360deg)
- **Page-Level Animations**:
  - Home: Hero background zoom, feature cards stagger, featured recipes section with animated title
  - Recipes: Animated page header, recipe cards with stagger effect
  - RecipeDetail: Hero image scale, sequential content reveals (title, ingredients, steps with delays: 0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s), nutrition sidebar slide-in from right
  - Menu: Animated header, 3 option cards with stagger effect (delays: 0.2s, 0.3s, 0.4s), icon scale on hover
  - MenuByDay: Animated header, form card, and result card on generation
- **Accessibility Features**:
  - Respects user's `prefers-reduced-motion` system preference
  - Zero-duration transitions for reduced motion users (instant rendering)
  - All hover/tap animations disabled when reduced motion is enabled
  - CSS utility classes (hover-elevate, transition-*, transforms) neutralized via media query
  - Dual-layer protection ensures no motion triggers for accessibility users
- **Animation Patterns**:
  - Entrance animations: opacity (0 → 1), y/x transforms (20px → 0), scale (0.95 → 1)
  - Interaction animations: hover scale, tap scale, icon rotation, card lift
  - Timing: smooth easing curves, appropriate delays for stagger effects (0.1-0.15s intervals)
  - Duration: 0.3-0.8s for most animations, instant (0s) for reduced motion users

## Backend Architecture

**Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server

**API Structure**: RESTful endpoints using Express routes:
- `/api/chat` - AI chatbot interaction endpoint

- `/api/menu/generate-meal` - Individual meal recipe generation (budget, servings, diet, optional dish name)
- `/api/menu/generate-from-ingredients` - Multiple recipe suggestions from available ingredients (ingredients, servings, optional budget, diet, skill level) - generates 2-4 different dishes

**Development Setup**: 
- Vite middleware for HMR in development
- Custom logging middleware for API requests
- Static file serving in production

**Data Layer**: 
- In-memory storage implementation (MemStorage class) for user management
- Schema defined using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
